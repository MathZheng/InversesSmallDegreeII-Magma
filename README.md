# InversesSmallDegreeII-Magma
Magma progrems for  "On inverse of permutation polynomials of small degree over finite fields, II"
These are the Magma progrems for verifying the correctness of our resluts on small finite fields.
I sugesst unziping these progrems to "D:\\MagmaSmallDegreeII" so that you can copy the existing paths.
